  <h1 style="width: 400px;">What your BMI result means</h1>

  <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
  healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
  such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
  fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
  strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
  five days a week.</p></div>
